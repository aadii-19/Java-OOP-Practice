The Variables inside the abstract classes are `Static and final`
Mostly specifies what the classes are doing and not how it's doing so that's why it has empty methods mostly
--> Interfaces contains only abstract whereas abstract can contain both abstract and non-abstract classes
--> You can't create objects of interfaces
--> Final variables is initialised coz interfaces doesn't have constructors
--> Abstract can provide the implementation of interface but not the other way around
--> Can implement multiple interfaces using `implements`
--> two classes which are unrelated to each other can implement the same interface
--> Interface has a light overhead when compared to methods so it so not advised to use in performance oriented codes.
--> Interfaces can also extend a class and then when it is implemented by another class then every methods in both the classes should be extended
--> IMPORTANT : We can't implement one interface with another but can use another interface by ~Extending~ it.
--> @Annotations in itself is an interface
